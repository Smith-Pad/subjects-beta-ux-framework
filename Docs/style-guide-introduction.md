# style-guide-introduction

Welcome to the documentation. This documentation and section talks about
the introduction to the style guide for developing the UX. The style guide
will be updated constantly based on some decisions, changes, and improvements
for the Subjects-VA-2 Beta UX



## Main Menu

In this section, we are going to be talking about the main menu style guidelines
for it.


For the main-menu the UI style guidelines for it should say the subjects header on
the top left corner of the UX. 



## Single View (Second Screen kinda)

For the second screen view, the back button will be on the top and the header name will
be on the top as well. If necessary, this might be moved to the bottom for accessibility purposes
likewise.
