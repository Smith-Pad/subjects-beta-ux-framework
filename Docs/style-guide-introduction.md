for the Subjects-VA-2 Beta UX



## Main Menu

In this section, we are going to be talking about the main menu style guidelines
for it.


For the main-menu the UI style guidelines for it should say the subjects header on-
the top left corner of the UX. 



## Single View (Second Screen kinda) (In Progress) 

For the second screen view, the back button will be on the top and the header name will
be on the top as well. If necessary, this might be moved to the bottom for accessibility purposes
likewise. For the header bar, the Back button can be adjusted based on the individual preferences 
and types of devices that is used on.
